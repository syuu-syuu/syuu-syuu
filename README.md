## Hi, I'm Lizzy ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer with experience in data engineering and analysis, mobile, fintech, and web development. I'm a recent Information Science graduate from UNC Chapel Hill and I am actively seeking for SDE job opportunities in Canada.

# ðŸŒ± Current Projects
### SyncIt
***A Notion-to-Excel export tool that generates customized, multi-tab spreadsheets with reusable templates.***
